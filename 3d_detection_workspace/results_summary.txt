3D OBJECT DETECTION RESULTS - KITTI Dataset
============================================

Test File: data/kitti/training/velodyne/000008.bin
Date: December 7, 2025
Environment: Lightning AI Studio (CPU mode)

MODEL COMPARISON:

1. PointPillars (pointpillars_hv_secfpn_8xb6-160e_kitti-3d-car.py)
   - Total Detections: 10 objects
   - Top 5 Confidence Scores: [0.9750, 0.9682, 0.9457, 0.8905, 0.8890]
   - All detections: Cars (label 0)
   - Average Top-5 Confidence: 0.9337
   
2. SECOND (second_hv_secfpn_8xb6-80e_kitti-3d-car.py)
   - Total Detections: 11 objects
   - Top 5 Confidence Scores: [0.9443, 0.9171, 0.9130, 0.7841, 0.7433]
   - All detections: Cars (label 0)
   - Average Top-5 Confidence: 0.8804

KEY FINDINGS:

✓ Both models successfully processed KITTI point cloud data
✓ PointPillars: Higher precision (fewer but more confident detections)
✓ SECOND: Higher recall (detected 1 additional object)
✓ PointPillars achieved ~5% higher average confidence on top detections
✓ Both models specialized in car detection (class 0)

TECHNICAL SETUP:
- PyTorch: 2.1.2+cu121
- MMCV: 2.1.0
- MMDetection3D: 1.4.0
- NumPy: 1.26.4
- Execution Mode: CPU (CUDA voxelization had kernel config issues)

CONCLUSION:
PointPillars showed better precision with higher confidence scores,
while SECOND demonstrated slightly better recall with one additional detection.
Both models are effective for 3D car detection on KITTI dataset.
